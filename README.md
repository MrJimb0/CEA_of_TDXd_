You will find the following files: A plotting file that largely used DAMPACK to generate the graphs for the manuscript The probabalistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) file that generates the main results for the manuscript; it uses transition properties from the 7 and 8 state files The base case CEA The appendix explains in detail why there are two seperate 7 and 8 state transition files. Briefly, we use the 7 state to derive the final transition rate (from the terminal to dead) used in the 8 state model.

The data folder as a csv output from the main PSA used to create the graphs for the manuscript
